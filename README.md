# USACO Problems
A collection of solutions to problems from the _USA Computing Olympiad_. <br>

Most of these are suboptimal solutions, but pass all test cases, or as many as practically possible in the programming language (many use Python 3, which is generally slow when run on CPython. There is no option for PyPy 3 on the judging servers. My newer code is written in C++, but I have not pushed it yet). <br>

### The USA Computing Olympiad
The USA Computing Olympiad is a nationwide qualifying youth competition, similar to the USAMO, and which hosts four contests annually, one every month from December–March. Anyone can participate in the [competition](usaco.org). Top canidates are selected to attend a rigorous summer camp, and the four best represent the U.S. in the [International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI)](https://ioinformatics.org/), the most prestigious youth programming competition. <br>

### Side Note
When looking for official solutions to problems, it is advised to use the editorial. The main reason this exists is for new programmers to the competition who find it hard to understand editorials and do not know C++ or Java. This is also why I have been slow at pushing my newer code for silver/gold problems written in C++—the code here is quite old. <br>
I have also solved many problems from the USACO Guide, but have decided not to share those problems because many are the same as problems here, but each also has a quality explanation, user solutions, and an editorial.
