# USACO Problems
A collection of solutions to problems from the _USA Computing Olympiad_. <br>

Most of these are suboptimal solutions, but pass all test cases, or as many as practically possible in the programming language (many use Python 3, which is generally slow when run on CPython. My newer code is written in C++). <br>

### The USA Computing Olympiad
The USA Computing Olympiad is the most prestigous youth competition, which hosts four contests annually, one every month from Decemberâ€“March. Anyone can participate, regardless of age, [here](usaco.org). Top canidates are selected to attend a rigorous summer camp, and the four best represent the U.S. in the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI).
